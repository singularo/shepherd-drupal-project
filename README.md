# Composer template for Shepherd Drupal projects

This project template should provide a kickstart for managing your site
dependencies with [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/).

This repository is a fork of [drupal-project](https://github.com/drupal-composer/drupal-project).

## Usage

First you need to [install composer](https://getcomposer.org/doc/00-intro.md#installation-linux-unix-osx).

> Note: The instructions below refer to the [global composer installation](https://getcomposer.org/doc/00-intro.md#globally).
You might need to replace `composer` with `php composer.phar` (or similar)
for your setup.

After that you can create the project:

```
composer create-project universityofadelaide/shepherd-drupal-project my-project --stability dev --no-interaction
```
